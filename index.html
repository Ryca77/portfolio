		<h3>Meet Ryan</h3>
		<p>I am a front end web developer skilled in designing and coding user interfaces and applications using a number of tools including HTML5, CSS, Javascript and JQuery. I'm inspired by beautifully simplistic user experience and ensure the consumer is always at the centre of the design and development process, from initial conception to finished product. Integral to this is responsive design and delivery of an equally effective interface regardless of screen size.</p>
		<p>Before getting involved in product creation and delivery I had a 15 year career in media and digital adtech business development, working with the world's biggest brands, media agencies, content platforms and advertising channels. This experience compliments my development skills by giving me a deeper understanding of a project's commercial requirements, particularly when it comes to monetization of content.</p>
		<p>I live in South West London and with my wife and two daughters.</p>
